Relay BNNS Integration
==========================
**Author**: `Egor Churaev <https://github.com/echuraev>`_

Introduction
------------

Apple BNNS library is a collection of functions that can be used to construct neural networks
for inference (and train). Itâ€™s supported in macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. BNNS provides
primitives executed on all CPU supported on those platforms and optimized for high performance
and low-energy consumption. This integration will offload as many operators as possible from Relay to BNNS.

This guide will demonstrate how to build TVM with BNNS BYOC and runtime enabled. It will also provide example
code to compile and run models using BNNS runtime. Finally, we document the supported operators.

Building TVM with BNNS support
----------------------------------

To turn on TVM BNNS BYOC and TVM BNNS runtime you need to turn on the only USE_BNNS flag

* USE_BNNS=ON/OFF - This flag will enable compiling a network with offloading subgraphs to BNNS primitives
  and will link tvm library to the BNNS runtime module.

Example setting in config.cmake file:

.. code:: cmake

    set(USE_BNNS ON)

BNNS partitioning of Relay graph
----------------------------------------

Operations to be offloaded on BNNS execution must be annotated before passing of module for compilation.
All opps annotated by `partition_for_bnns` will be offloaded for BNNS execution. The rest of the ops
will go through the LLVM compilation and code generation.

Important note: `partition_for_bnns` requires to freeze parameters before the annotations of ops for BNNS.
This can be done by passing of special parameters to some importers like `from_onnx(onnx_model, freeze_params=True)`
or to pass params to `partition_for_bnns` function

.. code:: python

    from tvm.relay.op.contrib.bnns import partition_for_bnns
    with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):
        model = partition_for_bnns(model, params=params)


Input data layout for operations to be offloaded to BNNS execution
----------------------------------------

BNNS kernels support only planar format of input data. The partitioner will require to have NCHW input
layout for conv2d input.

To use BNNS integration for models with interleave input layout, they should be converted before
passing of module to `partition_for_bnns`. The layout conversion will happen only for explicitly
enumerated types of ops. It might happen that depending on topology there might be regular data reorder
around conv2d to interleave and planar layout. This will be reflected in performance penalties and affect
execution time. It is recommended to analyze the whole topology and extend below list to convert all
intermediate tensors to NCHW data layout.

Example of input layouts change:

.. code:: python

    # For models with NHWC input layout
    with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):
        mod = relay.transform.InferType()(mod)
        mod = relay.transform.ConvertLayout({"nn.conv2d": ["NCHW", "default"],
                                            "nn.bias_add": ["NCHW", "default"],
                                            "nn.relu": ["NCHW"]})(mod)


Build and Deploy Mobilenet v2 1.0 with BNNS
----------------------------------------

Create a Relay graph from a MXNet Mobilenet v2 1.0 model.

.. code:: python

    import tvm
    from tvm import relay
    import mxnet
    from mxnet.gluon.model_zoo.vision import get_model

    dtype = "float32"
    input_shape = (1, 3, 224, 224)
    block = get_model('mobilenetv2_1.0', pretrained=True)
    module, params = relay.frontend.from_mxnet(block, shape={'data': input_shape}, dtype=dtype)


Markup the parts of graphs to be offloaded to BNNS primitives. All ops which are supported by the BNNS
integration will be handled by BNNS invocations, the rest of the ops will go through the
regular TVM llvm compilation and code generation.

After that you need to compile new module with target corresponding to required Apple platform

.. code:: python

    from tvm.relay.op.contrib.bnns import partition_for_bnns

    # target for macOS Big Sur 11.1:
    target = "llvm -mtriple=x86_64-apple-darwin20.2.0"

    with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):
        model = partition_for_bnns(model, params=params)  # to markup operations to be offloaded to BNNS
        lib = relay.build(model, target=target, target_host=target, params=params)

Export the module.

.. code:: python

    lib.export_library('compiled.dylib')


Load module and run inference on the target machine with TVM  built with ``USE_BNNS`` enabled

.. code:: python

    import tvm
    import numpy as np
    from tvm.contrib import graph_runtime

    ctx = tvm.cpu(0)
    loaded_lib = tvm.runtime.load_module('compiled.dylib')
    gen_module = tvm.contrib.graph_runtime.GraphModule(loaded_lib['default'](ctx))

    dtype = "float32"
    input_shape = (1, 3, 224, 224)
    input_data = np.random.uniform(0, 1, input_shape).astype(dtype)
    gen_module.run(data=input_data)
